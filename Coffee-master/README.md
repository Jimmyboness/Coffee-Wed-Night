## Get creative.

Hi there. We've done quite a bit of writing HTML & CSS
to match layouts. Now it's your turn to get creative.
Use the HTML you've been given, and design it to your liking.
BUTâ€¦ you have to use the requirements below:

## Content

Here's a new thing: There's content in a file called source.txt.
Your turn to turn this into HTML.

## Layout requirements

* The header should be full-width with a background image.
* The paragraphs at the top should be in a 2-column grid.
* The quote in the header should be centered.
* The individual coffee options should conform to a grid. The number of columns is up to you.
* At the bottom, add a `<footer>` and include at least 3 links to your favorite coffee companies or coffeeshops. Use a grid.

## Technical requirements

* Use a free [Google webfont](https://www.google.com/fonts)
* Specify line-height.
* Use the inline-block method to create a grid.
* Make granular commits. Always Be Pushing! (APB)

## Bonus

* CSS-only drop cap on first letter of first paragraph.

## Nicely designed gridded sites
